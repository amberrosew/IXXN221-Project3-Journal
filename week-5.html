        <p> Monday 8th August:
        <br>
        <br>
        Today I was primarily working on the different elements of project 1. My goal was to finish 
        everything except for the detailed user flow diagram. While adding on to my user persona and 
        empathy maps, I started really getting a good idea of what the needs of my users would be 
        and I found it forced me to think outside of the box. Developing the user persona helped me 
        put myself in someone else shoes, which then made writing the empathy maps far easier.

      Thursday 11th August:
      <br>
      <br>
        I finalized my detailed user flow today, which was quite the challenge. I found that I was 
        having to simplify things quite a bit more than I would have liked because otherwise, the 
        flow diagram was going to be way too hard to follow (and I was going to have way to much 
        work in the future projects). It was definitely a learning experience, but it also helped me 
        reflect on the UX laws when I was deciding what to cut. I then did a lot more of the 
        write-up aspect of this project. I found that while doing the writing up I wasn't necessarily 
        learning anything new, but it was helpful to have to put the things that I was thinking/already 
        knew into words on the page, and gave me a lot more clarity about my assignment.
