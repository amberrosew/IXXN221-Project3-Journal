    Today was the hand-in for the assignments, so I didn't do any more work on mine. 
    It was really helpful though to see what everyone else had been working on, and 
    how they had approached the task. I noticed that most people when doing the 
    empathy map did it as if it was what the user was saying before they found the 
    website, whereas I did mine as if they were currently on the website/had already 
    used it. It's likely that I was the one that interpreted that task wrong, but 
    also I think my approach still really helped me. And since mine is a more entertainment-based 
    website, it almost makes more sense to do it this way. They wouldn't have many 
    questions/frustrations about things before using the website, so by doing my empathy map as 
    if I was going through the process with them I had a really good idea of the hurdles/bumps in 
    the road they might come across. So while it may not have been the typical approach, I think 
    it was better suited to the purposes of my website.
