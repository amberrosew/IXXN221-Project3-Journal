        <p> 
          Today I learned how to set up a basic HTML website I had a lot of issues because the '!' shortcut didn't work, 
          so I ended up spending almost an hour trying different ways to get it to work so 
          I wouldn't be stuck typing everything out every time. Eventually, I found 
          that if I typed out the doctype line and just wrote “doc”, the rest of it came 
          up as suggested. After that, I just played around with adding text like on the lecture video
          It was super helpful to learn, as I've only ever coded in p5.js or Arduino before but I've been wanting to learn HTML coding
          to go along with that so that I can combine the 2 and create some visually interesting websites while also having more control
          over the back end of the technology. The weirdest part about switching languages was having to remember to open and close 
          each action, and the different ways to write comments. I kept finding myself trying to just put a '//' instead of the proper
          HTML format is out of habit. While I didn't really learn any design skills from today, it was great to learn the basics of how 
          to set up a website
