          <br>
          Today after the progress presentations I started developing my work more in Figma. 
          I had the basic layout of all my key "types" of pages done, so all that was left for 
          me to do was insert all the content to those pages, and then make some more with the 
          same layout, just different content. It's still quite time-consuming, but it's really 
          helpful to have everything finalized(ish) before making all 30-40 web pages I need to 
          for this assignment. I've also added in a "stats" page, which I'm still unsure if I'm 
          going to include or not. It's the kind of thing I'd be interested to know, and could 
          motivate people to play again to try to get an uncommon ending/make more progress. However, 
          for the sake of coding this assignment, it would just be pictures of graphs, not actual 
          stats. So I'm very on the fence about it since there'll also be a lot of people who would 
          don't even care

        <br>
         <br> 
          I've now linked all my pages up so you can click through them using the button. I decided 
          to add a slight cross dissolve between pages, as that's something that I like on a webpage, 
          however I'm not sure how that would be implemented with code, so we'll see if it ends up 
          happening
