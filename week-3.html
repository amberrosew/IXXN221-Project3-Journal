        Monday 25th July
        <br>
        <br>
        Today I started looking at different websites that I think have really nice designs. I found a common factor among 
        them was having subtle animations going on. I felt like this made the website more engaging, and made it feel smoother 
        and more put-together than the ones. It was also just more interesting to look at so I found that I was far more 
        likely to stay on the site for longer than I would have without the animations. I also liked how playful they were. I 
        feel like a lot of web design feels really minimal and clinical. It's easy to get caught up in the coding, but coming 
        from a creative coding background I think it's often the small and simple details that make the design so much better. 
        I'm not sure if my coding skills will be good enough by the time I reach the end of the assignment to incude these 
        animations, but I hope I can at least incude the more colourful/textural elements that these websites have.
        <br>
        I also started thinking about more ideas for my assignment. At the moment I'm quite stuck. My only solid idea is to make 
        a portfolio website - but it feels like a bit of a cop-out when I could be creating something to include IN my portfolio 
        instead. On of my other ideas  was to make a website to tell tourists about budget-friendly things to do when visiting 
        Wellington. That idea was inspired by my trip to Auckland last week, when my firends and I 
        spent tonnes of time wandering around trying to figure out what we wanted to do because everything was either really 
        expensive, or we didn't know where to look. I was also debating doing some kind of informative website, and I could 
        combine that with the sort of "choose your own adventure" idea, so the user clicks through and sees the consequences of 
        their actions/decisions. I really like the idea, but I'm not sure what the issue would be. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Sunday 31st July
        <br>
        <br>
        Today I chose the user that I'll create the persona and started working on making their profile. I settled on 
        Robin Buckley from stranger things, since I've just rewatched the show so I've got pretty good idea of her character. 
        I also think she's a good example of the target audience for my website - which brings me to the next thing I did today. 
        I came up with a kind of plan for what my "choose your own adventure" website is going to be about. At first, I wanted to do 
        something to do with a current issue and the impact small decisions we make can have on it, but honestly the things most 
        people do have such a small impact in the grand scheme of things it felt kinda wrong to make a website pushing for individual 
        responsibility on huge issues. I then thought about doing it on some kind of moral dilemma, here the user is pushed to do 
        more and more morally grey things so I could almost trick the user into becoming a bad person/doing something they at 
        first would have considered "wrong". But ultimately I couldn't come up with an idea of the sort of questions to do that and 
        spent far too much time contemplating what I'd ask rather than things like the user journey, goals, design ideas, etc. But 
        now I've settled on creating a website that's mainly just for fun/storytelling. It'll be a murder mystery where the user is 
        a guest at a hotel and has to make decisions based on things that happen. Some of the outcomes could be you survive and 
        don't realize anything was wrong, you solve the mystery, you get killed, you witness a murder, you're accused of being the 
        murderer, etc. I'm going to write a story plan and user flow later on, but for now, I'm happy with having a solid idea of what 
        my outcome will be a little like.
