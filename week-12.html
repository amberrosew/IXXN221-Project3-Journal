          Overall, I've learned a lot in this class. I came in no HTML knowledge at all, 
          but with a bit of experience in javascript. I thought I had a decent grasp on 
          how coding works, since (even though these languages aren't compatible with 
          HTML code) I also have experience in Arduino and UnReal Engine coding. But HTML 
          was very different to all of those. The little things like adding closing brackets, 
          having to link to a stylesheet, and the different way to comment things out kept throwing 
          me off. Learning to use grid and padding was also a HUGE learning curve because I 
          was used to just being able to set the location of something in an X/Y axis, not having 
          to rely on grids and padding to make things go in the places I wanted to. But I'm glad 
          I pushed myself to create my second assignment using code, as otherwise, I wouldn't have 
          even half the understanding of code that I have now. And beyond being able to execute my plan, 
          I learned a lot about the development and planning process of a website through assignment 1. I 
          learned to appreciate the importance of understanding the user, and it was good to have a 
          refresher on the UX laws as I haven't had to focus on them for a while. Another ting that took 
          abit for me to learn was appreciating minimalistic design. I usually lean more into maximalism, 
          and have always found it hard to make things look minimal but not boring. So my first instinct is 
          to add as many elements as possible. But webdesign doesn't work like that. It's a lot harder to 
          arrange things in space, and I found myself frced to learn this new style of design in order for my 
          website to look good and follow the laws of UX. And now I'm far more comfortable creaing minimalist 
          designs that I don't feel look unconsidered, or unfinished. There are some things that I wish 
          I spent more time learning and exploring, but there always will be in web design. In 
          the future I want to learn more about how to combine my knowlege of javascript and creative coding 
          with my new understanding of HTML coding to create more visually interesting websites, and rely less 
          on images to introduce interest to the site.
