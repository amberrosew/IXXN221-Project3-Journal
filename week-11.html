          This was the last class before hand-in, so the majority of my time was spent 
          just trying to improve my work as much as possible. The feedback I received 
          was really helpful, as it's very hard to see some of the small things that 
          aren't clear in your work when you've been staring at it for so long. And through 
          the feedback, I was able to see my work through a more skilled critical eye, and 
          was actually able to pick up on some of the things that were annoying me rather 
          than just staring at it knowing that something was off, but not knowing what. This 
          is a skill I hope to keep improving as I do more web design. The lecture was also one 
          of the most helpful so far, as I had a very bad understanding of divs and how they're 
          utilized within grids. Seeing the walkthrough of the website and having the way it would 
          be coded broken down in an easy and understandable way helped so much. As it came quite 
          late in the trimester, I wasn't going to use it in my project 2 as that'd mean re-doing 
          everything. But I actually used it a lot in my MDDN 333 class. In the assignment, we had 
          to create a prototype product. I had originally planned to just do the prototype in Figma 
          like most other people were, but as my understanding of grids and divs increased I realized 
          I was actually capable of coding it myself. So while it may not have been something I used in 
          this class, it helped me out in my other classes. And I can only imagine how much it will 
          help me in the future.
