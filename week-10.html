          In class, we went through editorX some more. Like last week, it was good to see the possibilities 
          of the software so I can imagine ideas for future projects. I continued to work on my assignment 
          and managed to get the majority of the coding done by Wednesday. The thing I found hardest when 
          coding was definitely wrapping my head around grids. I found it difficult to get the alignment right 
          and found it difficult to make it scalable. But once I got the hang of everything, it was far easier. 
          This assignment forcing me to improve my understanding is definitely something that will make me a 
          better coder in the long run, and it allows me to create designs that are far more visually pleasing. 
          After doing all my coding and playing around with the fonts a bit, I sent my work off to Shiv to get 
          some valuable feedback on my work.

          One of the biggest challenges I ran into with my work was the transitions. I wanted to have a slight 
          fade effect as each page loaded, but a lot of the tutorials did it in an overly complicated way. In the 
          end, I managed to find one that did it in a relatively simple way through javascript. I've used 
          javascript before, so the familiarity definitely helped, but I've always struggled with the timed elements
          you can use. So what should have been a simple transition ended up being way harder than I thought. But 
          I'm glad I took the time to figure it out, as I now have a way better grasp of how transitions work in 
          HTML, and how to link various coding methods.
          <br>
          The other challenge was making the site responsive. I admittedly forgot it was a thing and coded all 
          30ish pages before realizing that I didn't do it. So I was a bit stressed when It came to changing things 
          around. Luckily - it was way simpler than I thought. It took me a little bit to figure out, but once I 
          got it changed it worked well across the whole site thanks to the fact that the text amount was relatively 
          similar on each page.
