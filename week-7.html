    Over the break, I've just been developing my prototype. I haven't used Figma very much, 
    I've mainly been preparing my assets to go on the pages. After doing some sketches on paper, 
    I decided I wanted each page to have an image as the backdrop, so I've got to do quite a few of those 
    for the different stages of the story. Having a background change makes the user feel 
    more like they're making progress. So I've been working on those (I might just do a more 
    simple version of them for this assignment, and add more details to the drawings later on if 
    I have time). I've also been working on the writing element and getting some of the text to 
    go on each page. I also experimented with a grey-boxed version of my prototype for mobile on Figma, 
    but I don't plan on continuing with the mobile version. I realized since mine was going to be coded, 
    it'll be quite a bit harder to develop the mobile version as well, so I'll just stick with the desktop

    In class today we went through grids. That was definitely helpful for me and helped 
    me get a really good idea of how I could implement my design ideas in code. It was 
    something that I was attempting to do on the blogs earlier on in the trimester, but 
    couldn't figure out since I didn't really know what I was even looking for. I plan 
    to use it in my blogs as well later on potentially, but right now I just don't have 
    time to implement it due to having such a large assignment load.
