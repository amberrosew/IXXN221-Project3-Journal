      Before Class 
      <br>
      <br>
      I watched the lecture this morning and went through and started playing around with it in 
      my code. It was really helpful to learn about the CSS file, because up until now I had been 
      adding everything to the header on each page, so my code was super long. Now my code is way 
      easier to read, and it's going to save me from constantly copying and pasting between pages whenever 
      I want to change a little thing about the style of my pages.

  Studio Tasks:
  <br>
  <br>
    The task was to create a box with a border, margin, and outline. This really helped me get a 
    grasp on the way images works within HTML code. I don't plan on incorporating images with harch 
    borders into my assignment, but I'll probably have some that I want to bend into the website as 
    seamlessly as possible so having a good grasp of the tools is really helpful

     Wednesday 3rd August
     <br>
     <br>
      Today I started getting more into my user persona and catering it to my design/idea. I 
      had written up a user persona for Robin Buckley a few days ago, but since I didn't have a 
      solid idea for my website I hadn't done any of my user goals of empathy maps. So I got more 
      stuck into those and while doing that I started thinking about the journey that my user could 
      take. Doing these maps helped me get a better idea of the extent to which I have to develop the 
      "plot", and helped me start thinking about the kind of aesthetic I want for my project.

    Saturday 6th August 
    <br>
    <br>
     I've begun to actually write down my plan for my user journey. Nothing is at all neat yet, 
      but it helps me to have a super messy version where I just write down every idea that comes to 
      my head so I can cut it down from there. I've been trying to think about the structure of the 
      folders and amount of pages that will be necessary for this project. A lot of the code will be 
      quite similar and all I'd have to do would be change the words, but I want my project to be 
      really interesting and visually pleasing as well. I think a lot of the visuals will come down to 
      a nice background image that I'll draw for each location that the user would come across, as the 
      text could be in a header box (now that I know how to do that from the lecture). That would save 
      A LOT of coding work if I just focus the visuals on something I can draw rather than trying to 
      learn how to do it entirely in code. Plot-wise, I know roughly what I want the story to be, it's 
      just a matter of being able to sit down and write exactly where the decisions come in and how 
      that will affect the outcome. I learned how to go back a few folders in the directory, so it's 
      possible that I could just make a user go down specific folders each time a crucial decision is 
      made. That would help me follow the story as well as I would be able to kind tell it just by 
      looking at the folders where in the plot I am. The "plot" will basically be the user and their 
      friend going to a hotel to attend an event, hearing noises coming from a room and choosing whether or not 
      to investigate, they find a dead body, and from there they can run or find clues in the room. Then 
      they decide if they still attend the event that night, and at the event is where everything comes 
      to a head. Depending on how much extra coding I think it will be, there'll be a few characters and 
      about 4-6 endings ranging from really good to really bad.

      Sunday 7th August: 
      <br>
      <br>
      After thinking about it for a couple of days, I've decided that I'm 
      going to cut out the event from the plot and have the user just pick what clues to look at/take, 
      and then they have to run away and make a few choices while they try to escape/get help. The whole 
      event thing was making it super complicated because I was looking at introducing various suspects 
      and then they'd have to find clues on top of that - which would involve a lot of work and coding. So 
      this project is going to be more like a snippet of what could be in the grander story. It would also 
      mean I can focus on learning some slightly more complicated coding - which is what I wanted to get 
      out of this course.
