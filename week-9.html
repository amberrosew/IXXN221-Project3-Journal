          Today for class we went through the basics of editorX. It seemed to be a very helpful software
          that would come in really handy for designing things beyond the bounds of your skills as a coder.
          Although, it would take me a while to get used to the nature of the interface. But it did help me 
          think about the possibilities of things I could do with code. However, as I'm not using editorX 
          in my assignment, I spent most of my time coding my website. This was the first week we started 
          building our websites, so my main focus for the week was getting the basics of my website built. 
          I also used class time to gather feedback from tutors on what I had done so far. At this stage, I'd 
          only coded the first page and was working on the layout. So I made sure to get their opinions in 
          the early stages before I went and made too much progress that was hard to undo.
